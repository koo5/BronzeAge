"The Bronze Age is a time period characterized by the use of bronze, proto-writing, and other early features of urban civilization."
- from Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

the goal: to free newbies (in any area) from the burden of the past and showcase projects attempting to drag computing from the stone age.
let us match and compare the projects and see where they can really replace the legacy.

A lot of work has been done. Lets use it. Dont learn bash, learn fish. use a semantic-aware terminal. Get a selection of the
best languages and IDEs.

roadmap:
select projects, create installation scripts
hunt down tutorials and links to videos
try creating a wholesome desktop experience


#stuff to include:..

fish
zsh
oh-my-fish, oh-my-zsh

wizzard for installing some useful stuff:

C:

Lets use clang as a little example here. The vision is to create a desktop full of these
things, where the state of the art tools jump out at users. The goal is that when
you think about programming in C, you start in this folder, not on google that tells
you to install gcc and CodeBlocks and assures you C is the best language for ANY PROJECT EVER!
So we could have a folder on the desktop called "C".
